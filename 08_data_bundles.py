# Here we have a data bundle also called class or struct.
# It has two variables in this context called members
# and a function in this context called method.
class SomeData:
	a: int
	b: int
	
	def __init__():
		self.a = 0
		self.b = 0

my_data = SomeData

# This method ran automatically above this line here,
# the moment it is getting initialized.

my_data.a = 1

# With the little point you can access the struct's members and methods.
