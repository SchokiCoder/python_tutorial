# There are plenty of operators.
# 1st let us look at the arithmetic ones.
addition = 1 + 1
subtraction = 2 - 1
multiplication = 4 * 3
division = 12 / 3
remainder = 12 % 5		# (of a division)

print("Arith: ", addition, " ", subtraction, " ", multiplication, " ", division, " ", remainder)

# These can be combined with the assignment operator.
